# Tic-Tac-Toe
It's a Tic-Tac-Toe program with 3 modes: `Two Players`, `Smart Computer` and `Random Computer`

## Two Player mode
In this you have to set :
```
x_player = HumanPlayer('X')
o_player = HumanPlayer('O')
```    
before running the program. And play between you and your friend :)

## Smart Computer mode
<!-- Utility function -->
In this you have to set:
```
x_player = HumanPlayer('X')
o_player = SmartComputerPlayer('O')
```
before runnuig the program. And Play between you and A.I and try to beat the computer :)

In this the A.I. for the ```SmartComputerPlayer('O')``` is programmed by the `Minimax algorithm` built off of a Maximizer and minimizer concept. Basically you're trying to maximize your win while your opponent is trying to minimize their loss.

## Random computer mode
In this you have to set:
```
x_player = HumanPlayer('X')
o_player = RandomComputerPlayer('O')
```
before running the program. And see what moves does the computer makes while you make your move :)
